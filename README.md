# Simple task management backend using GraphQL, Nodejs, Prisma stack

### Technical note

This simple trello-cloned backend system provides simple functionalities such as create and update List and Task. This can be done using standard CRUD GraphQL API. Also, tasks within the list can be reordered so clients can freely move items in the list. This is the most tricky part and I am not sure how to achieve this. The only industry standard technique that I found is to use the [LexoRank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQv9xMoFbg) which is a sorting technique used by JIRA software. There is also a small unit test to ensure the validity of the reordering function. I am planning to add more if time allows though :). And that's pretty much everything. Happy coding ðŸŽ‰


## Introducing the Alpha

Alpha is the new startup company we are developing a cutting edge task management system with modern technology.

You will be getting involved on this! We have setting up user service to manage user in our system but we still missing our core business logic which is the task management.

## Functionality

### Task management

- Create a new list
- Create a new task in a list (the task should be prepended to the list and the
  status should indicate it has not been completed)
- Update a task (title and status)
- Delete a task or list
- Move a task to a specific position in the list
- Retrieve all lists and their tasks

## Getting start

- [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
- [Setup](#setup)

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have these tools installed

- Docker
- Node.js
- Node package manager, preferably `pnpm`

### Setup

This is the instruction to setup this project and run in your local machine. Note that this instruction uses `pnpm` as a package manager. You may replace these commands corresponding to your package manager.

1. Copy `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`.
2. Install dependencies.
3. Run `docker compose up -d` to start docker containers in background.
4. Run `pnpm db:migrate` to initiate database.
5. Run `pnpm codegen` to generate TypeScript definition for GraphQL and Prisma client.
6. Run `pnpm start` to start the project.
7. Go to `http://localhost:4000`, you should see Apollo Playground with two queries `users` and `user`. You may change the port according to `GATEWAY_PORT` in your `.env` file.


### Running test
```
pnpm test
```
